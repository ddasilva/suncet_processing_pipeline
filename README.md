# SunCET Data Processing Pipeline

## Input
* To get to Level 0b: Raw binary files downlinked from the spacecraft
* To get to Level 0c, 1, and 2: the output of the preceding level

## Output
| Level 0b | Level 0c | Level 1 | Level 2 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Raw images with metadata in header | Added ancillary data needed to produce L1 | Images with dark and flat field corrections | Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) catalog: average speed and acceleration, height-time, speed-time, and acceleration-time plots, movies |
